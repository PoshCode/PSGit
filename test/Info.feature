Feature: Get repository status
    In order to customize our command prompts,
    And know if what branch we're on, and whether changes have been made upstream
    We need a Get-Info command which returns information about the repository and its remotes


    Scenario: There's no Repository
        Given we are NOT in a repository
        When Get-GitInfo is called
        Then the output should be a warning: "The path is not in a git repository!"

    Scenario: Empty Repository
        Given we have initialized a repository
        When Get-GitInfo is called
        Then the output should have
            | Property | Value          |
            | Branch   | master         |
            | Note     | Initial Commit |

 
    Scenario: New Files in Repository
        Given we have initialized a repository with
            | FileAction | Name          |
            | Created    | FileOne.ps1   |
            | Created    | FileTwo.ps1   |
            | Created    | FileThree.ps1 |
        When Get-GitInfo is called
        Then the output should have
            | Property | Value          |
            | Branch   | master         |
            | Note     | Initial Commit |

            | Created    | FileTwo.ps1   |
            | Created    | FileThree.ps1 |
            | Added      | *             |
        When Get-GitInfo is called
        Then the output should have
            | Property | Value          |
            | Branch   | master         |
            | Note     | Initial Commit |
