Feature: Get a list of file changes
    In order to customize our command prompts,
    The one thing we absolutely must have as objects is the status
    We will have three commands for this:
    Get-GitChange, Get-Info, and Show-Status (which will wrap the other two)

    # This is a freebie, so that there's something not @wip
    Scenario: There's no Repository
        Given we are NOT in a repository
        When Get-GitChange is called
        Then the output should be a warning: "The path is not in a git repository!"

    Scenario: Get-GitChange should have similar parameters to git status
        Given we have a command Get-GitChange
        Then it should have parameters:
            | Name           | Type     |
            | PathSpec       | String[] |
            | HideUntracked  | Switch   |
            | ShowIgnored    | Switch   |
            | HideSubmodules | Switch   |

    Scenario: Get-GitChange should allow fetching only un/staged changes
        Given we have a command Get-GitChange
        Then it should have parameters:
            | Name         | Type   |
            | UnstagedOnly | Switch |
            | StagedOnly   | Switch |

    Scenario: Empty Repository
        Given we have initialized a repository
        When Get-GitChange is called
        Then there should be no output

    Scenario: New Files in Repository
        Given we have initialized a repository with

            | Created    | FileThree.ps1 |
        When Get-GitChange is called
        Then the status of git should be
            | Staged | Change | Path          |
            | False  | Added  | FileOne.ps1   |
