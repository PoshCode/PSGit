A task-based, object-oriented, pipeline-focused implementation of git, providing a new command-line interface in PowerShell functions.

## Installation

Install it from PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-Module PSGit
```

## Status

The current `master` branch has reached the point where it's sufficient to replace my use of `posh-git` (for building prompts), but doesn't yet have anything like a `write-vcsstatus` for default prompt output.

Our intent is to take full advantage of the object Pipeline and create task-based commands following the verb-noun syntax of PowerShell.  The [Command Proposals](https://github.com/PoshCode/PSGit/wiki/Command-Proposals) are a list of the commands we probably need to implement, and how they map to `git` commands.

## Secondary Goals

We're also using this project as a way to test out a process of co-working and doing TDD in PowerShell projects -- we'll have one or two people writing specs and tests and we'll be asking other people to implement the commands to pass the tests.

Therefore, we want you to [get involved](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
